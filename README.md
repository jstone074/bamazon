* Once the table loads the end user will be prompted with with two questions, which product to purchase and how much. The application will check to verify that the end user only enters in an ID that is available. 

* Once the end user enters in a valid ID the application will ask for a quantity. Bamazon will then check to see if there is sufficient quantity to order. If there is, a price will be calculated. If there isn't the process will start over

* Once the transaction has comnpleted succesfully Bamazon will ask the end user if you would like to continue. If "yes" is selected a query will be done and show the updated quantities that are available after the most recent purchase. If "no" is selected then the application closes.
